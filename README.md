# Disaster-Response-Text-Classification
Web app to classify texts from disaster response times into a fixed set of categories.

<br>This uses the disaster response dataset from [Figure 8]( https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/combined-disaster-response-data/)

<br>This was done as part of the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree

<br>I have hosted this app on Heroku. It can be accessed [here](https://vijkar-figure8-disastertextclf.herokuapp.com/)
